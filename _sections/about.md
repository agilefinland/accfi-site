Agile Coach Camp Finland is a **weekend retreat** of brilliant, curious minds sharing and building knowledge together.

We give space for great things to emerge for people who help others get better in their thinking and doing - such as agile coaches / scrum masters, organizational / business coaches, consultants, tech coaches / seniors - to share in the form of an open space. *You* are welcome to join us for in-depth discussions about developing software, people and organizations. You can try out new ideas, facilitation techniques, games, practice programming with katas and dojos, get advice on a burning problem of yours or even jam with a guitar, do yoga, or go on a hike together.

The event takes place 7.- 9.9.2018. The price of attendance is basically room and board for the length of the coaching camp and will be less than 400â‚¬. 

We will open the registration during Spring 2018. There will be a limited amount of places: around 40.
