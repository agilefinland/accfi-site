**Agile Coach Camp Finland** is a **weekend retreat** of brilliant, curious minds **sharing and building knowledge together**.

We give space for great things to emerge for **people who help others get better in their thinking and doing** - such as agile coaches / scrum masters, organizational / business coaches, consultants, tech coaches / seniors - to share in the form of an open space. *You* are welcome to join us for in-depth discussions about developing software, people and organizations. You can try out new ideas, facilitation techniques, games, practice programming with katas and dojos, get advice on a burning problem of yours or even jam with a guitar, do yoga, or go on a hike together.

On Friday, we spend the day with **pre-scheduled workshop topics**. Full Saturday and Sunday morning until midday we run an **open space conference**, facilitated by Diana Larsen, Antti Kirjavainen and Karoliina Luoto. It's not all work, we'll make sure there's sessions that take you from head space to physical space too.

The event takes place **20.-22.5.2016** and location is  **[Herrankukkaro](http://herrankukkaro.visualizer360.com/)**. The tickets include getting there from Helsinki or Turku Railway station.
