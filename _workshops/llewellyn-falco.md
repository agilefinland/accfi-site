Coaching requires a combination of quickly assessing where the group your coaching is. What the individual needs of each participant are at any given moment and transferring knowledge, skill and habits to the people you’re coaching.

Mobbing (working together as a group) is an excellent way to achieve all this. It helps you to quickly assess where everybody is, and with that knowledge, you can start to introduce exactly what it needed. You get to see if the things you are saying are transferring into actions in the participants immediately.  And you don’t have to waste time explaining things they already know.

In short, mobbing allows for 1:1 mentoring experience with an entire group.

Come learn how to facilitate this for technical sessions. This will be an exercise-intensive workshop to give you your first experiences in what it is like to facilitate programming work in this manner.

Some learnings from this session: 

* Getting started with a mob
* Setting up an environment
* Avoiding common mistakes in facilitating a mob
* Working with code you’re unfamiliar with
* Optimizing for when you’re gone
* Coaches Bag of Tricks
